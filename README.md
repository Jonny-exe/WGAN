# WGAN

Implementation of WGAN generator in order to generate images from the MNIST datset. 
I didn't use gradient penalty because I thought it would be too forgiving, with such a simple datset.

The implementation is written in pytorch, following the original papers ([GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661), [WGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875))

These are the results. They obviously can be improved, but I think they are a good baseline.
